# About The License

FireJS and projects made with it are under the FireLicense1.0, a custom license targeted for web-site development whilst conforming to free software ideals.

This license shouldn't get in your way while developing, just remember that only your user is allowed to delete their own data. Unless you send them a message that can verify that they've read the entire thing. Then you may delete, or restrict, their data after 7 weeks; unless it is illegal then this condition does not apply. For more information feel free to read the included `LICENSE`.

Also don't forget to keep a link to you source code, which must also be under the same license; again feel free to read the license for more information.
